## Reflections
#hello there!

Reflections are just used to check if the git hub pages are set accordingly and are working well.
This is jut a dummy texy with no meaning what so ever. I just needed to fill up my read me file.
So i decided to just put in some mumbo jumbo dummy text to see how the git hub pages work.
